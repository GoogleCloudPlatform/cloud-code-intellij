/**
 * Indicates that the annotated field should replace the registered service in the application's
 * [PicoContainer][org.picocontainer.PicoContainer].
 *
 *
 * This is often used in conjunction with the [Mockk][io.mockk.mockk] annotation to replace
 * the real service with a mock. [ContainerToolsRule] handles the set-up and tear-down involved
 * for these services. For example, this is all that is required for a mocked `XxxService`
 * to substitute the real service in the [PicoContainer][org.picocontainer.PicoContainer]:
 *
 * ```
 * @get:Rule val  ContainerToolsRule rule = new ContainerToolsRule(this)
 *
 * @TestService @MockK mockXxxService: XxxService
 * ```
 *
 * Now this mock can be used like any other Mockk variable:
 *
 * ```
 * every { mockXxxService.getData() } returns listOf()
 * ```
