/**
 * An instance of this class represents a feature in one of our plugins. The sole purpose of a
 * {@code feature} is to determine whether to enable the corresponding functionality using the
 * {@link PluginInfoService} and the {@link PluginConfigurationService}. The algorithm that
 * determines whether a given {@code feature} configuration is enabled is as follows:
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li>If the current platform the plugin is running in is contained in the list of {@link
 *       #getSupportedPlatforms()}, then the feature is enabled.
 *   <li>If the plugin's config.properties file contains a key with {@link #getResourceFlagName()}
 *       set to {@code true}, then the feature is enabled.
 *   <li>If there is a system environment variable named {@link #getSystemFlagName()} with a value
 *       of "true|TRUE", then it's enabled.
 *   <li>In all other cases, the feature is disabled.
 * </ol>
