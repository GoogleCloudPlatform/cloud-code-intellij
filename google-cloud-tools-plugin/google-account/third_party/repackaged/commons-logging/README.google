Description:
The Logging package is an ultra-thin bridge between different logging
implementations. A library that uses the commons-logging API can be used with
any logging implementation at runtime. Commons-logging comes with support for a
number of popular logging implementations, and writing adapters for others is a
reasonably simple task.

Local Modifications:
We had to modify the original contents to place it under a different (combined) package.
This was done because there were conflicts with related packages in the Android
Open Source Project.
