/**
 * A utility class that loads the icons that are used by the Google Login plugin.
 * <p/>
 * Using this class to load icons is preferred over creating scaled image icons manually in code,
 * as this utility class will automatically select the appropriate icons based on the current
 * theme (IntelliJ classic vs. Darcula) and will automatically select high resolution icons
 * for retina displays.
 * <p/>
 * To ensure the appropriate icons are selected, they should be named according to the
 * following rules:
 * <p/>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>icon_name.png - The IntelliJ classic image icon to use.</li>
 *   <li>icon_name@2x.png - The IntelliJ classic image icon to use for retina displays.</li>
 *   <li>icon_name_dark.png - The Darcula image icon to use.</li>
 *   <li>icon_name@2x_dark.png - The Darcula image icon to use for retina displays.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p/>
 * Note that if no alternative image icons are specified, the single provided image icon
 * will be used in all themes and resolutions.
