Description:
The Jetty Web Server provides an HTTP server and Servlet container capable of
serving static and dynamic content either from a standalone or embedded
instantiations.

Local Modifications:
We had to modify the original contents to place it under a different package.
This was done because there were conflicts with related packages in the Android
Open Source Project.
