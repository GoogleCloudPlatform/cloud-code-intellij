Description:
Inspired by the quality and variety of XML tooling available for the Java
platform (StAX, JAXB, etc.), the Jackson is a multi-purpose Java library for
processing JSON data format. Jackson aims to be the best possible combination of
fast, correct, lightweight, and ergonomic for developers.

Local Modifications:
We had to modify the original contents to place it under a different (combined) package.
This was done because there were conflicts with related packages in the Android
Open Source Project.
